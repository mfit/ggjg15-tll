"The Little Lobbyist"

A take on the theme >>WHAT DO WE DO NOW<< ?

It's about ...
    ... how a group of people or a society can arrive at decision / come to a conclusion
    ... lobbyism
    ... experienced in the setting of a random house party in the mid-2020s that is about to relocate

By engaging in dialogue, and mentioning certain topics to certain people, you, as one party-guest, try to influence
the majority-decision of the group ... But beware, each member of the group has her or his preferences - and influences
other members of the group, as modeled by the underlying hidden social graph.
